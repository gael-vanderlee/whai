# Project Vision

## What is terma?
terma is a Python CLI tool called "Terminal Assistant". It brings a large language model (LLM) into your terminal and acts as a context-aware helper for terminal work. The user stays in control at all times—the assistant fits into your real shell environment and never takes over or creates a separate shell.

## Goals
- Provide natural-language-to-command translation
- Analyze, explain, and help fix problems in the terminal
- Always require explicit user approval before running commands

## Features
- Start with: `terma "your question"`
- Captures context from `tmux` scrollback (for full context), otherwise falls back to parsing your shell history file for recent command context
- Supports user-defined roles via markdown files in `~/.config/terma/roles/`
- Maintains a separate persistent shell session; all changes like `cd` or `export` last for the session, but do not affect your regular terminal session
- Prompts before running any commands, using `[a]pprove`, `[r]eject`, `[m]odify`
- Optionally, can provide shell helpers (such as keybindings), but these are not part of the core experience

## Usage Examples

### 1. Find the largest folder:
- User: `terma what's the biggest folder here, excluding node_modules?`
- terma reads context and suggests `du -sh * | grep -v 'node_modules' | sort -rh | head -n 5`
- If approved, runs command and prints results

### 2. Post-mortem analysis after a failure:
- User: `terma why did pipx install fail?`
- If `tmux` is running, context and output help terma suggest a fix (such as `sudo apt install python3-dev`) for user approval

### 3. General info:
- User: `terma what is a .wget-hsts file?`
- terma displays an explanation, does not suggest any dangerous action

## Core Philosophy
The assistant always requires user confirmation, informs and guides rather than acting autonomously, and is designed to make the terminal safer and more usable—never disruptive.
